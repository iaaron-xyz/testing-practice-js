# Test practice
In this project the goal is to test 5 functions with the purpose to understand and implement the TDD (Test Driven Development) approach in which the test cases are written before the code or function to be tested, this method minimizes errors in posterior stages of the development process. In particular, for this project, the tool to be used is `Jest`.
## How to run the tests
To run the test, enter into the working directory
```
cd testing-practice-js
